# Wasteagram

Wasteagram is a mobile app built with Flutter that enables coffee shop employees to document daily food waste in the form of "posts" consisting of a photo, number of leftover items, the current date, and the location of the device when the post is created.

Uses a Firebase Cloud Firestore database instance to persist all post data and a Firebase Cloud Storage to store and retrieve post images.
